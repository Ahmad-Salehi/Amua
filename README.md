## Welcome to Amua 

Amua is an open source modeling framework.  “Amua” is Swahili for “decide” or “solve”.  Amua provides a common user interface (UI) for developing various types of models.  Models can be run in Amua or exported to other programming languages, thus allowing conceptual models to be separated from any particular implementation.  This approach allows a language-agnostic approach to modeling, and ensures maximum flexibility.  The user interface for Amua also provides an intuitive way to create and visualize models.  Amua can be used as a teaching tool, or by advanced researchers seeking a unified modeling framework.  The software is written in Java and can be used on any operating system with a Java Virtual Machine installed.
