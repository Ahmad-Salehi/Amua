## Welcome to Amua 

Amua is an open source modeling framework.  From the Swahili word for "decide"/"solve", Amua is designed to be:
* **Transparent**: The graphical user interface provides an intuitive way to develop and document models.  As an open source framework, the underlying code is always available.
* **Flexible**: Models can be run in Amua or [exported](https://github.com/zward/Amua/wiki/Export) to other programming languages.  This allows conceptual models to be separated from any particular implementation, making it easy to change model platforms.
* **Accessible**:  Amua is free software and can be used as a teaching tool, or by researchers seeking an integrated modeling environment.  The software is lightweight and can be used on any operating system with a Java Virtual Machine installed.

Model types:
* [Decision Trees](https://github.com/zward/Amua/wiki/Decision-Trees)
* [Markov Models](https://github.com/zward/Amua/wiki/Markov-Models)
* Discrete Event Simulation (planned)
* Microsimulation Models (planned)
